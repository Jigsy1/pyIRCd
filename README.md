# pyIRCd
An IRCd written in Python and more or less based on ircu IRCds.

This is not meant to be used as a proper IRCd since there's far better alternatives for that. (Like actual IRCds.)

I'm mainly doing this as a pet project/to learn more about Python/to make myself even more unemployable than I am already. orz
